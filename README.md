# About Us

We're three undergraduates at Princeton University. We enjoy UNIX-like operating systems, politics, good coffee, whiteboards, Marvel Comics, and Team Fortress 2.

**Andrew Min** is a major in the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. **Cornellius Metto** is a major in the Computer Science Department. **Jess Patton** is a major in the Philosophy Department. But they're all equally hard-core nerds.

We use the [Skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com/) framework to power our front-end. It's awesome.
